        <td>You already know that heavy drinking during pregnancy can lead to serious birth defects. What you may not know is that even small amounts of alcohol could be harmful. No amount of drinking has been found to be safe during pregnancy, so it's best to avoid all forms of alcohol. This includes wine, beer, coolers, and traditional egg nog, which contains alcohol and raw eggs.</td>

          <img src="images/Nurtition & Fitness/What Not to Eat/caffeine.jpg" alt="caffeine" width="493" height="335" class="picture" /></td>
        <td>Good evidence now shows that a moderate amount of caffeine is safe during pregnancy. But the jury is still out on whether higher amounts of caffeine can increase the odds of a miscarriage. The March of Dimes recommends women who are pregnant or trying should limit caffeine to 200 mg per day. That's one 12-ounce cup of coffee. But remember, caffeine is also found in soda, tea, chocolate, and many energy drinks.</td>

        <td>Fish is good for you and your baby, but make smart choices about the fish you eat. Swordfish, tilefish, king mackerel, and shark contain high levels of methylmercury. This metal can be harmful to your baby. You can safely eat up to 12 oz. of seafood a week, so choose fish that are low in mercury: Catfish, salmon, cod, and canned light tuna. If you like albacore (white) tuna, limit yourself to 6 ounces per week. Check with your doctor before taking fish oil or any other supplements while pregnant.</td>

        <td>Fresh-squeezed juice in restaurants, juice bars, or farm stands may not be pasteurized to protect against harmful bacteria, including salmonella and E. coli. Some markets also sell raw, unpasteurized juice in the refrigerated case – look for the required warning label and steer clear.  Pregnant women should opt for juice that is pasteurized. Juice in boxes and bottles on your supermarket shelf is also safe.</td>

          <img src="images/Nurtition & Fitness/What Not to Eat/raw cookie dough.jpg" alt="cookiedough" width="493" height="335" class="picture" /></td>
        <td>When you&rsquo;re baking cookies, you may be tempted to pop a bit of raw dough in your mouth. But if the dough contains raw eggs, even a taste could pose a risk. The CDC estimates one in 20,000 eggs is tainted with <em>salmonella </em>bacteria<em>. </em>To be safe, resist tasting unbaked cookie dough, batter, or filling made with raw eggs. The good news: Store-bought cookie dough ice cream is safe.</td>

        <td>Enjoy some grated Parmesan on your pasta -- but pass up the cheese dip. Soft cheeses made with unpasteurized milk can harbor <em>listeria</em> bacteria, which can be dangerous or even life-threatening for you and your baby. It&rsquo;s best to avoid Brie, Camembert, feta, blue cheese, queso blanco, queso fresco, and panela -- unless the label says it's pasteurized. When in doubt or dining out, ask before you eat.</td>

        <td>Sorry, sushi fans, but it's time for a 9-month hiatus from this treat. Although seafood is a great source of protein, <em>raw</em> seafood can be a source of harmful parasites and bacteria. The FDA recommends pregnant women only eat fish and other seafood that has been cooked thoroughly.</td>

        <td>Now is the time to order all steaks and burgers well done. Raw or undercooked meat can harbor<em>toxoplasma </em>and a variety of bacteria. When dining out, make sure your meat is steaming hot and thoroughly cooked.  At home, the temperature should reach at least 145° F for whole cuts, 160° F for ground meats like hamburger, and 165°F for chicken breasts.</td>

        <td>Have you ever dreamed of visiting a farm and tasting milk fresh from a cow? Wait a while. Freshly collected milk has not yet been through the pasteurization process that protects it from <em>listeria</em>. That can be dangerous for you and your baby. Buy milk, cheese, or dairy products from a local farm only if the label says &ldquo;pasteurized.&rdquo;</td>
