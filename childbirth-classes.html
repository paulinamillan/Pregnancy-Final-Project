    <h1>Childbirth Classes</h1>
    <p>You've seen it in sitcoms and movies -- a woman giving birth is choking her partner during a contraction. Hilarious, unless you're the one in pain and your partner is clueless. You don't have to be in that position, though, when you take a childbirth class to prepare. Most expectant parents begin birthing classes when the mom-to-be is about 7 months pregnant.</p>
    <p>Classes differ in their focus and philosophy. But all types provide valuable lessons for labor, delivery, and postpartum issues. Some teach parents the medication-free methods of managing the pain of childbirth. Others begin early in a woman's pregnancy and focus on the changes that occur throughout pregnancy.</p>

        <td><p>As the most widely used childbirth method in the U.S., Lamaze classes approach childbirth as a natural and healthy process. Lamaze courses don't support or discourage the use of medicines or routine medical interventions during labor and delivery. Instead, they inform moms-to-be about their options so that they can make decisions for their own labor and delivery. Part of the Lamaze focus is on building your confidence or talking about how to keep your baby's birth simple and safe.</p>
          <p>Small classes consist of at least 12 hours of instruction and can provide you with information on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Normal labor, birth, and early postpartum care</li>
            <li>Different ways to position yourself for labor and birth</li>
            <li>Massage and relaxation techniques to ease pain</li>
            <li>Breathing techniques during labor</li>
            <li>Practicing relaxation by using internal and external focal points</li>
            <li>Support during labor</li>
