    <header>Your Pregnancy Week by Week: Weeks 17-20</header>
    <h2>Week 17</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Baby:Your baby, now about in its 15th week of development, measures about 4.4 to 4.8 inches from crown to rump and has doubled in weight in the last two weeks to about 3.5 ounces. Fat begins to form, helping your baby's heat production and metabolism. The lungs are beginning to exhale amniotic fluid, and the circulatory and urinary systems are working. Hair on head, eyebrows and eyelashes is filling in.</p>
      <p>Mom-to-be: You're showing more now, with an obvious swelling in your lower abdomen. A five- to 10-pound weight gain is typical by now. You also may be noticing an increase in appetite.</p>
      <p>Tip of the Week: Change positions slowly, especially when you move from a lying down position to sitting or from a sitting position to standing to avoid feeling dizzy or faint. If you feel lightheaded, sit down and lower your head, or lie down for a moment.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Week 18</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Baby: Your baby measures 5 to 5.6 inches from crown to rump and weighs about 5.25 ounces. The rapid growth spurt is tapering off, but reflexes are kicking in. It can yawn, stretch and make facial expressions, even frown. Taste buds are beginning to develop and can distinguish sweet from bitter tastes. The baby will suck if its lips are stroked and it can swallow, and even get the hiccups. The retinas have become sensitive to light, so if a bright light is shined on your abdomen, baby will probably move to shield its eyes.</p>
      <p>Mom-to-be: Your uterus, about the size of a cantaloupe, can probably be felt just below your navel. You're most likely feeling the baby move by now. A mid-pregnancy ultrasound may be performed between now and 22 weeks to assess fetal growth and development and to verify the due date. If the baby is in the right position, the ultrasound may even be able to determine whether it's a boy or a girl. Your heart has to work 40 percent to 50 percent harder now to support your pregnancy.</p>
      <p>Tip for the Week: Suggest that your partner go with you for the ultrasound. It's a chance to catch the first glimpse of your baby together, as well as provide a snapshot to show friends and family later. Sonograms still don't guarantee a healthy baby, but they can provide reassurance and spot some problems.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Week 19</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Baby: Your baby measures about 5.2 to 6 inches from crown to rump and weighs about 7 ounces. Skin is developing and transparent, appearing red because blood vessels are visible through it. Creamy white protective coating, called vernix, begins to develop.</p>
      <p>Mom-to-be: As your baby continues to grow, you may be feeling some mid-pregnancy aches and pains by now -- lower abdominal achiness, dizziness, heartburn, constipation, leg cramps, mild swelling of ankles and feet, and a backache. Dilated blood vessels might cause tiny, temporary red marks (called spider nevi) on your face, shoulders and arms.</p>
      <p>Tip of the Week: Take care not to get overtired since rapid growth of the baby can compound the burden on your heart, lungs and kidneys.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Week 20</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Baby: The fetus measures about 5.6 to 6.4 inches from crown to rump and weighs about 9 ounces. Your baby can hear sounds by now -- your voice, heart and your stomach growling, as well as sounds outside your body. It will cover its ears with its hands if a loud sound is made near you, and it may even become startled and "jump." The baby is moving often, too -- twisting, turning, wiggling, punching and kicking.</p>
      <p>Mom-to-be: Congratulations! You're at about the midpoint of your pregnancy. Your uterus is just about even with your navel. Your waistline has pretty much disappeared, but only temporarily! The risk of bladder infections increases because the smooth muscles in the urinary tract relax. Your breathing will become deeper and you may perspire more than usual from a more active thyroid gland.</p>
      <p>Tip of the Week: To alleviate backaches, maintain good posture. Sit with a footstool or use an ergonomic chair at the office, avoid standing for too long, sleep with a small pillow under your side at the waist, and lift things with your legs instead of your back.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>What's Happening Inside You?</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Hair is beginning to grow on your baby's head and lanugo, a soft fine hair, covers his or her shoulders, back, and temples. This hair protects your baby and is usually shed at the end of the baby's first week of life.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><img src="images/Second Trimester/Month 5/endofmonth.jpg" alt="endofmonth" width="210" height="260" class="picture" /></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Your baby's skin is covered with a whitish coating called vernix caseosa. This "cheesy" substance, thought to protect baby's skin from long exposure to the amniotic fluid, is shed just before birth.</p>
      <p>You may begin to feel your baby move, since he or she is developing muscles and exercising them. This first movement is called quickening.</p>
      <p>By the end of the fifth month, your baby is about 10 inches long and weighs from 1/2 to 1 pound.</p>
