    <h1>Countdown to Baby </h1>
    <p>You've got questions about labor and delivery, pain relief, and preparing for baby. We've got answers.</p>
    <h2><strong>Preparing for Baby</strong></h2>
    <blockquote>
      <h3><a href="childbirth-classes.html">Childbirth Class Options</a></h3>
      <p>Like painting the nursery or stocking up on disposable diapers, attending childbirth classes is often part of a couple's preparation for a baby's arrival.</p>
      <h3><a href="baby-essentials.html">What to Buy for Your Baby: The Essentials</a></h3>
      <p>Everything you need to take care of your baby during the early months.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2><strong>Labor and Delivery</strong> </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Vaginal Delivery </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Vaginal delivery is the most common and safest type of childbirth.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Prolonged Labor </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>How quickly your bundle of joy arrives depends on many things, including how fast something called labor is happening.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>Normal Labor and Delivery Process</h4>
    <p>After months of anticipation, your baby's due date is near. Here's what you can expect from the start of labor until the first days and weeks with your new baby. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cesarean Section (C-Section) </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A cesarean section is the delivery of a baby through a cut (incision) in the motherâ€™s belly and uterus. It is often called a C-section. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Vaginal Birth After C-Section (VBAC) </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>If you have had a cesarean delivery (also called a C-section) before, you may be able to deliver your next baby vaginally. This is called vaginal birth after cesarean, or VBAC.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>Pain Relief Options for Child Birth</h4>
    <p>There are a number of different medications a woman can take during labor and childbirth. Here are the options. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Inducing Labor </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>If a pregnancy isn't proceeding as it should, or if the health of the mother or baby is threatened, doctors may have to speed up the process by inducing labor.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4><img src="images/Countdown to Baby/Labor and Delivery/comingsoon2.jpg" alt="comingsoon2" width="300" height="300" class="picture-right" />Stages of Labor</h4>
    <p>Labor happens in three stages; here's what to expect during each of them.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Delivery of Your Premature Infant </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A premature delivery may happen suddenly or after days or weeks of waiting and worrying. If you know you may deliver early, you, your partner, and your doctor can prepare for a premature birth.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Water Birth </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Water birth is still considered an alternative birthing method, and not every doctor is convinced that it is safe. However, more and more hospitals are beginning to offer water births as a delivery option.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Midwives and Home Birth</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>For centuries, midwives have provided care to women during childbirth. Midwives today offer this care to women not just during the birthing process, but also throughout their reproductive lives.</p>
