        <td>Take a load off your legs! Cycling on a stationary bike is generally safe even if you're just starting an exercise program. Spinning is a good way to boost your heart rate without stressing your joints. As your belly grows, you can raise the handle-bars for greater comfort.</td>

        <td>The beauty of Kegel exercises is that you can do them anytime, anywhere, without anyone knowing. Kegels strengthen the muscles that help hold up your uterus, bladder, and bowels, which helps labor and delivery. To do them, squeeze your pelvic muscles as if you're trying to stop urinating or passing gas. Hold for five seconds and relax. Repeat 10 times, five times a day.</td>

        <td>As a mom-to-be, you're focused on doing everything you can to have a healthy baby! Exercise is good for both you and your little one. In fact, the right moves can ease common discomforts like back pain and sleep troubles. One of the best exercises is swimming. It's gentle on your joints and relieves swollen ankles. And you'll feel light as a beach ball no matter how big your baby bump. Check with your health care provider before starting or continuing exercise in pregnancy.</td>

        <td>Whether you're on a trail or a treadmill, walking can safely help tone your muscles and improve your mood. It's also something most women can do right up to delivery. If you're just starting, try walking a semi-swift mile three days a week. Increase your time and speed a little each week, and build in hills as you get stronger.</td>

        <td><p>Yoga strengthens core muscles, eases, and helps you relax. And research shows that it may make labor shorter and more comfortable. Try a prenatal class, which is gentler and focuses on relaxation -- good prep for labor. Avoid the &quot;hot yoga,&quot; Bikram, and after your first trimester, don't lie on your back. If something doesn't feel right, check with a fitness expert.</p></td>
