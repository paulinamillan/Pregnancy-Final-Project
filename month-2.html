    <h1>Month 2 </h1>
    <h1>Your Pregnancy Week by Week: Weeks 5-8</h1>
    <h2>Week 5</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Baby: Your baby is still tiny, but its heart, brain, spinal cord, muscle, and bones are beginning to develop. The placenta, which nourishes your baby, and the amniotic sac, which provides a warm and safe environment where your baby can move easily, are still forming, too. The umbilical cord forms and connects your baby to your blood supply.</p>
      <p>Mom-to-be: You might suspect by now that you're pregnant. You may also notice some early symptoms of pregnancy:</p>
      <p>Feeling nauseous (called morning sickness, although it can happen at any time of day or night</p>
      <p>Tingling or soreness in your breasts and darkening of your nipples</p>
      <p>Needing to pee more often</p>
      <p>Feeling more tired than usual</p>
      <p>Tip of the Week: You'll want to schedule a visit to your ob-gyn as soon as you suspect you're pregnant. Starting prenatal care early and keeping up with your appointments is a large step toward having a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Week 6</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p> Baby: Your baby is shaped like a tadpole, and it's about the size of a BB pellet. The eyes and limb buds are forming. During an ultrasound, your doctor may be able to hear a heartbeat. Between days 17 and 56 is a vulnerable time, because that's when the baby is most susceptible to anything that can affect normal growth.</p>
      <p>Mom-to-be: You may have gained a few pounds by now. Or if you're having morning sickness you may have lost weight -- that's normal, too. You may start noticing some changes in your body: clothes getting a little tighter around your waist, fuller legs and breasts. With a pelvic exam, your doctor will notice a change in the size of your uterus.</p>
      <p>Tip of the Week: Follow good prenatal habits each day, like eating healthfully and taking prenatal vitamins. If you haven't already, stop smoking and drinking alcohol.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Week 7</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Baby: Your baby is growing. Limb buds appear that will grow into hands and feet. Many parts continue to develop: heart, lungs, intestines, appendix, brain, spinal cord, nostrils, mouth, and eyes.</p>
      <p>Mom-to-be: You're still not "showing," but by now you're really feeling the changes in your body. You may still have morning sickness, and your breasts probably still feel tingly and tender.</p>
      <p>Tip of the Week: Never let your stomach get completely empty -- that will help you from feeling queasy. Keep snacks on hand around the clock, and eat lots of little meals rather than three big ones. To prevent a drop in blood sugar, eat some protein, like adding cheese to crackers.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Week 8</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Baby: Your baby is now about in its sixth week of development. It's a big week for growth. Eyelid folds and ears are forming. Your baby develops little webbed fingers and toes and can even swim around in your womb.</p>
      <p>Mom-to-be: Your blood volume is increasing, and your heart is pumping 50% more blood per minute for your baby. Common symptoms for this week are moodiness and queasiness from certain smells.</p>
      <p>Tip of the Week: Wear a supportive bra. Good breast support during pregnancy will help you feel more comfortable and prevent future sagging. Exercises to keep your chest muscles toned can be useful, too.<img src="images/First Trimester/Month 2/end of month.jpg" alt="end of month" width="210" height="240" class="picture-right" /></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>What's Happening Inside You?</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Your baby's facial features continue to develop. Each ear begins as a little fold of skin at the side of the head. Tiny buds that eventually grow into arms and legs are forming. So are fingers and toes.</p>
      <p>The neural tube (brain, spinal cord, and other nerve tissue) is well formed. The digestive tract and sensory organs begin to develop. Bone starts to replace cartilage.</p>
